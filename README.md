# Flappy Bird (C++ & Raylib)

A re-creation of the classic Flappy Bird game, built with C++ and the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) game programming library. This project aims for a simple, fast, and fun experience, showcasing game development in C++ with modern tooling.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your system:

* A C++ compiler that supports C++20 (e.g., GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 19.29+).
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.10 or higher).
* [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html#download) development libraries.
  * **Linux (e.g., Ubuntu/Debian):** `sudo apt install cmake g++ libraylib-dev`
  * **macOS:** `brew install cmake raylib`
  * **Windows:** Install CMake and a C++ toolchain (like MSVC with Visual Studio Community or MinGW-w64). Raylib can be installed via `vcpkg` or by downloading precompiled binaries and setting up your environment variables. Refer to the [Raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Setup-build-environment) for detailed Windows setup.

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ph8n/flappybird.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd flappybird
    ```

3. **Create a build directory and configure CMake:**
    It's standard practice with CMake to build out-of-source.

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Build the game:**
    This command will compile the project using the build system generated by CMake (e.g., Makefiles on Unix, Visual Studio solutions on Windows).

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

5. **Run the game:**
    The executable will be located in the `build` directory (or a subdirectory like `build/Debug/` on Windows).

    ```bash
    ./flappybird
    ```

    (On Windows, it might be `.\Debug\Flappybird.exe` or `.\Release\Flappybird.exe` depending on your build type).

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

* Launch the game using the installation instructions above.
* Press the **arrow up** or **click** to make the bird flap its wings and go higher.
* Navigate the bird through the gaps in the pipes to score points.
* Avoid colliding with the pipes or the ground.
* Try to beat your high score!
